#  Super Bowl Odds Update: Steelers Favored Over The Patriots

The Pittsburgh Steelers have been the odds-on favorite to win the Super Bowl all season long, and that has not changed in the wake of their dominating victory over the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship game. The Steelers are now listed as a 3-point favorite over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI.

The Patriots made it to the Super Bowl by coming back from a 25-point deficit against the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship game, but they will face a much tougher test against the Steelers. Pittsburgh has one of the most explosive offenses in the NFL, led by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown. The defense is also stout, with players like linebacker Ryan Shazier and defensive end Cameron Heyward.

The Patriots will need to play their best game of the season if they hope to beat the Steelers. Tom Brady has been outstanding this postseason, but he will need some help from his teammates if New England is going to pull off the upset.

The Falcons are still a longshot to win the Super Bowl at odds of +800, but there is no doubt that they are one of the most dangerous teams in the NFL. Atlanta had one of the best offenses in league during the regular season, and they showed their ability to come back from big deficits in both rounds of the playoffs.

The Falcons will have their hands full against the Patriots in Super Bowl LI, but they certainly have a chance to pull off an upset. Matt Ryan has been playing at an MVP level this season, and Julio Jones is arguably the best wide receiver in football. If Atlanta can get strong performances from their top players, they could be celebrating a Super Bowl victory on February 5th.

#  NBA Championship Odds: Golden State Warriors Favored Over Cleveland Cavaliers

The Golden State Warriors are currently the favorites to win this year's NBA Championship. The Warriors have odds of -190, while the Cleveland Cavaliers have odds of +160.

The Warriors are coming off a championship season in which they won 73 games during the regular season. They then went on to win the NBA Finals, defeating the Cavaliers in six games. This year, the Warriors look even stronger, with the addition of Kevin Durant.

The Cavaliers are coming off a disappointing loss to the Warriors in last year's NBA Finals. However, they should not be counted out this year. LeBron James is still one of the best players in the NBA, and Kyrie Irving is one of the most dynamic scorers in the league. The Cavaliers also added Isaiah Thomas in a trade with the Boston Celtics this offseason.

It will be interesting to see how these two teams match up this year. The Warriors have a great starting lineup with Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, and Zaza Pachulia. The Cavaliers have James and Irving in their starting lineup, as well as Tristan Thompson and J.R. Smith off of the bench.

Both teams are sure to give each other a tough battle this year. However, I believe that the Warriors will come out on top and win their second straight NBA Championship.
