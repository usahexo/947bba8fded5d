#  EA argues that loot boxes aren't gambling, but gamers disagree

Electronic Arts (EA), one of the world's largest gaming companies, has been in the news a lot lately. But it's not for their new games – it's for their stance on loot boxes.

Loot boxes are in-game rewards that can be obtained by spending real money. They typically contain randomized items, including skins, costumes, and other cosmetic items. But some gamers allege that loot boxes are a form of gambling, because they offer a chance to win valuable in-game items.

In October 2017, the Belgian Gambling Commission ruled that EA's Star Wars Battlefront II was in violation of gambling laws, because of its use of loot boxes. The commission said that Battlefront II constituted a "mix of gaming and gambling".

EA responded by saying that loot boxes aren't gambling, because you can't lose money or possessions betting on them. They also argued that loot boxes are not addictive, and are only meant to enhance the gaming experience.

But many gamers disagree with EA's assessment of loot boxes. Some say that they're addicted to opening them in the hope of getting a good item, and that they've wasted money on loot boxes when they've obtained nothing but trash items. Others argue that microtransactions like loot boxes constitute a form of gambling, because they allow players to spend money in order to increase their chances of winning valuable items.

Whether or not you believe that loot boxes are a form of gambling is ultimately up to you. However, it's clear that there is significant disagreement about this issue within the gaming community.

#  UK Gambling Commission rules that loot boxes are not gambling

The UK Gambling Commission has ruled that loot boxes are not gambling, following an investigation into the matter.

The ruling was made after the commission looked into the way loot boxes are used in video games and whether they constitute a form of gambling. The commission said that it doesn't believe that loot boxes meet the legal definition of gambling, as there is no "wagering" taking place.

This is a major win for video game publishers and developers who have come under scrutiny in recent months over the use of loot boxes. Some lawmakers and campaigners have argued that loot boxes are a form of gambling and should be regulated in the same way as traditional casino games.

However, the commission has now ruled that this is not the case, saying that players always receive something for their money when purchasing a loot box, even if what they get is not necessarily what they were hoping for.

This decision will likely be welcomed by video game publishers and developers, who have defended loot boxes against accusations that they are a form of gambling. However, it's possible that this issue will continue to be debated in the coming months and years, as some people believe that loot boxes do constitute gambling and should be better regulated.

#  Study finds that most gamers think loot boxes are a form of gambling

Loot boxes in video games have been a controversial topic for some time now. Many gamers feel that they are a form of gambling, and that the practice should be illegal.

A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Utah has found that the majority of gamers believe that loot boxes are a form of gambling. The study surveyed over 2,000 individuals who regularly play video games.

The study found that 73 percent of respondents felt that loot boxes were a form of gambling. Furthermore, only 32 percent felt that they were not a form of gambling.

Those who felt that loot boxes were a form of gambling were more likely to have negative feelings about them. Seventy-eight percent of those who felt that loot boxes were a form of gambling said that they felt “bad” or “very bad” about them.

This isn’t the first time that the issue of loot boxes has come up. In October 2017, lawmakers in Hawaii introduced a bill titled the “Stop Predatory Gambling Act of 2017”. If passed, the bill would classify any game with randomized rewards as an illegal lottery.

Despite this, many video game companies continue to use loot boxes in their games. Some feel that they are necessary in order to generate revenue, while others argue that they are simply a way to exploit gamers.

#  Belgium declares that loot boxes are a form of gambling

The Belgian Gaming Commission has ruled that loot boxes in video games are a form of gambling, and as such, must be regulated. The Commission’s ruling follows a study it conducted into the matter, which found that four out of the nine games it looked at contained mechanics that could be classified as gambling.

This means that game publishers who want to continue selling their games in Belgium will need to get licenses to do so, and will be subject to a whole range of regulations around how loot boxes can be offered. The Commission is also calling on game developers to prominently label games containing loot boxes as “gambling games”.

It’s not yet clear what sort of impact this ruling might have on the wider gaming industry. The UK Gambling Commission is said to be carrying out its own investigation into loot boxes, but has yet to release any findings. However, given how widespread the use of loot boxes has become in recent years, it’s likely that more countries will start taking a closer look at them too.

Loot boxes are virtual items that can be earned or bought in games like Overwatch, CS:GO and FIFA 18. They usually contain a random selection of in-game items, such as weapons or skins, which players can use to customize their characters.

Gamers have long been concerned that loot boxes are a form of gambling because they involve spending money on something with no guarantee of getting anything good in return. This concern was amplified late last year when Star Wars Battlefront 2 offered customers the chance to spend real-world money on loot crates that contained various in-game items.

Following an outcry from gamers and lawmakers alike, EA eventually decided to temporarily remove all microtransactions from Battlefront 2. This led some people to argue that loot boxes don’t actually constitute gambling, as there’s no real-world financial loss if you don’t get what you want from them.

However, the Belgian Gaming Commission has now dismissed this argument, stating that “the activity of gambling consists of risking something of value on an event with an uncertain outcome” - which certainly applies to loot boxes.

#  EA announces that they will no longer include loot boxes in their games

Gamers rejoice! Electronic Arts (EA) has announced that they will no longer include loot boxes in their games. The popular gaming company made the announcement on their website, stating that they are “working to create a more balanced and equitable approach” when it comes to how players access in-game content.

Loot boxes have been a source of controversy in the gaming community for some time now. Many gamers argue that the mechanic is nothing more than a form of gambling, as it often encourages players to spend money in order to get a chance at getting better gear or items. In some cases, games like Star Wars Battlefront II have been criticized for featuring loot boxes that give players an unfair advantage over those who don’t spend extra money on the game.

EA’s decision to remove loot boxes from their games is a good step forward for the gaming industry. Hopefully, this will encourage other developers to follow suit and do away with this predatory mechanic.
