            <h1 id="Napoli-remain-in-Europe-despite-460-odds"><a href="#Napoli-remain-in-Europe-despite-460-odds" class="headerlink" title="Napoli remain in Europe despite -460 odds"></a>Napoli remain in Europe despite -460 odds</h1><p>Ahead of their final Champions League group game, Napoli found themselves as massive underdogs.<br>Best price available on a losing Napoli bet was -460 at SportPesa. However, they pulled off an improbable 2-1 victory over Liverpool to finish second in their group and qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League.</p>
<p>Napoli were in good form leading up to the match, with four wins and one draw in their last five matches. Their only previous loss in that run came against Juventus, who are currently leading the Serie A table. Liverpool, meanwhile, had suffered three consecutive defeats prior to Wednesday’s match.</p>
<p>Despite the odds heavily stacked against them, Napoli took an early lead through Lorenzo Insigne in the 24th minute. Liverpool equalized just two minutes later through Mohamed Salah, but Arkadiusz Milik scored what turned out to be the winning goal in the 69th minute.</p>
<p>It was a huge upset win for Napoli and eliminated Liverpool from European competition. They will now face reigning champions Real Madrid in the last 16 of the Champions League.</p>
<h1 id="Napoli-downgraded-to-fourth-favourite-after-Champions-League-exit"><a href="#Napoli-downgraded-to-fourth-favourite-after-Champions-League-exit" class="headerlink" title="Napoli downgraded to fourth favourite after Champions League exit"></a>Napoli downgraded to fourth favourite after Champions League exit</h1><p>Napoli have been downgraded to fourth favourite to win the Champions League after their exit from the competition at the hands of Liverpool.</p>
<p>The Italian side had been considered one of the frontrunners to lift the trophy prior to their last-16 clash with Jurgen Klopp’s men, but they were comprehensively beaten 5-1 on aggregate.</p>
<p>Liverpool are now 11/4 favourites to win the Champions League, while Barcelona are favourites at 6/4. Manchester City and Real Madrid are both priced at 3/1.</p>
<p>Napoli’s exit leaves Juventus as Italy’s only representative in the Champions League last eight. The Turin club are priced at 16/1 to win the competition.</p>
<h1 id="Bettors-still-have-faith-in-SSC-Napoli-following-disappointing-result"><a href="#Bettors-still-have-faith-in-SSC-Napoli-following-disappointing-result" class="headerlink" title="Bettors still have faith in SSC Napoli following disappointing result"></a>Bettors still have faith in SSC Napoli following disappointing result</h1><p>The last few weeks have seen little success for SSC Napoli, with the team only managing to win one out of their last five fixtures. This has led to some fans and bettors starting to lose faith in Maurizio Sarri’s side, especially after their disappointing 2-1 home defeat against Lazio on Sunday.</p>
<p>However, there are still many supporters of Napoli who remain confident that they will be able to turn things around. This is largely due to the club’s impressive track record in previous seasons, as well as their current position in the Serie A table.</p>
<p>Currently sitting in second place, Napoli are still well placed to challenge for the title and could potentially make a late surge for the top spot. They also have a relatively favourable fixture list in the coming weeks, with games against teams such as Chievo Verona, Udinese and Crotone.</p>
<p>These matches provide Napoli with a good opportunity to get back on track and start winning again. If they can manage to string a few victories together, they could quickly close the gap on leaders Juventus and potentially overtake them.</p>
<p>This would be a huge achievement for Sarri’s side and would show that they are still one of the best teams in Italy. It would also re-establish their credibility with fans and bettors alike, who may have been starting to doubt them in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Overall, there is still plenty of reason to believe in SSC Napoli and they should not be discounted just yet. Although they have had a few setbacks recently, they remain a very strong side that can achieve great things this season.</p>
<h1 id="Bookmakers-slash-Napoli’s-Champions-League-chances-following-heavy-loss"><a href="#Bookmakers-slash-Napoli’s-Champions-League-chances-following-heavy-loss" class="headerlink" title="Bookmakers slash Napoli’s Champions League chances following heavy loss"></a>Bookmakers slash Napoli’s Champions League chances following heavy loss</h1><p>Bookmakers have slashed Napoli’s chances of winning the Champions League following their heavy loss to Liverpool.</p>
<p>Napoli went into Tuesday night’s clash at Anfield as one of the 32 teams still in with a chance of lifting Europe’s elite prize, but they now face an uphill struggle after suffering a 5-0 thrashing.</p>
<p>That result saw them slip to third in Group C, five points behind Liverpool and two behind second-placed Paris Saint-Germain.</p>
<p>Napoli now trail PSG by three points with two games left to play and are all but guaranteed to finish behind Liverpool, who only need a point from their final two fixtures to progress to the knockout stages.</p>
<p>The defeat has seen Napoli’s odds of winning the Champions League slashed from 25/1 to 50/1, while they are also now out from 6/4 to 5/2 to win Serie A.</p>
<h1 id="Punters-take-advantage-of-napoli’s-poor-odds-following-Champions-League-exit"><a href="#Punters-take-advantage-of-napoli’s-poor-odds-following-Champions-League-exit" class="headerlink" title="Punters take advantage of napoli’s poor odds following Champions League exit"></a>Punters take advantage of napoli’s poor odds following Champions League exit</h1><p>Napoli’s Champions League exit at the hands of Feyenoord has seen their odds for the Serie A title tumble, with punters taking advantage to back them at attractive prices.</p>
<p>The Partenopei were considered among the favourites for Europe’s top prize this season, but they fell to a 3-1 defeat in Rotterdam on Wednesday evening. That loss means they now have to win their final group game against Shakhtar Donetsk by two clear goals in order to qualify for the last 16.</p>
<p>Such a scenario now looks unlikely, and that has seen Napoli’s odds for the Scudetto slashed. Maurizio Sarri’s side are now available at just 2/1 to win the championship, down from 5/2 prior to their European exit.</p>
<p>Juventus remain favourites to retain their crown, but they are now just ahead of Napoli at 11/10, with Roma available at 7/2. AC Milan are third favourites at 9/1, while Inter Milan (16/1), Lazio (25/1) and Fiorentina (33/1) complete the list of contenders.</p>
