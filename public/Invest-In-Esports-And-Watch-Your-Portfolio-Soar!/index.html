<p>Esports might seem like intimidating territory for beginner betters but with our help it needn’t be! Our guide covers everything from understanding odds markets through depositing funds into your sportsbook account; ultimately walking anyone through who wants make their first steps into Esports professional gambling - sound good? Let’s dive right in!  </p>
<p>Odds market:  So what actually ARE odds markets? In essence they’re just fancy terms used by various sportsbooks (online &amp; physical) predominantly when it comes down UFC &amp; Horse Racing (of which Esports fall under). As we stated earlier - no two Esports matches are ever the same - this goes especially for when it comes down tournament structures where matches run continiously day-by-day basis with varying individual match results affecting seeding for future rounds etc., meaning bookmakers need another way differentiate lines other than just who’s team is “favored”  over another on any given day (unless following pre-determined odds set prior publication). So how do “odds markets” work? We’ll use UFC as an example: say Conor McGregor - 1/4 favorite over Floyd Mayweather Jr 4/1 underdog . What this would mean from a betting perspective is that if someone were wanting bet £100 on Conor McGregor , their potential payout would be £25 (£100 returns £125) should McGregor win . Conversely if someone were wanting bet £100 on Floyd Mayweather Jr they would receive £400 (£100 returns £500) should Mayweather Jr win . As’you can see these odds illustrate how much risk/earnings potential backers would have depending upon who they chose to support , essentially boiling down risk VS reward levels stakes-holders could potentially endure when placing bets … pretty straight forward right?! Just remember when reading odds ALWAYS subtract your stake</p>
