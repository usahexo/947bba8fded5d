#  Aleast Three Aces in Your Five-Card Poker Hand? You're Almost Guaranteed To Win 

In poker, the odds of being dealt a particular hand are fixed. For example, the odds of being dealt a pair of aces is 1 in 6. This means that if you were to play poker with someone 100 times, on average you would be dealt a pair of aces just once. However, this does not mean that you will always be dealt a pair of aces. In fact, you may never be dealt a pair of aces during the 100 rounds of poker.

The same is true for all hands in poker. The odds of being dealt any particular hand are fixed, but this does not mean that you will always be dealt that hand. In fact, you may never be dealt that hand during the course of the game.

With that in mind, let's take a look at some of the hands with the best odds of being dealt. The following table shows the odds of being dealt each type of hand in Five-Card Poker*.

Odds Of Being Dealt Hand Type: 1 in 

Straight flush 36
Four of a kind 654
Full house 4432
Flush 8192
Straight 24828
Three of a kind 16796
Two pair 33392
One pair 66176
 *Odds are based on 80 million five-card poker hands. 

 As you can see from the table, the best hand to be dealt is a straight flush, which has odds of 36 to 1. This means that if you were to play poker with someone 100 times, on average you would be dealt one straight flush. However, again, this does not mean that you will always be dealt one straight flush during the 100 rounds of poker. In fact, it's very likely that you will never be dealt one during those games. 

 Next on the list are four of a kind, which have odds of 654 to 1. This means that if you were to play poker with someone 100 times, on average you would bedealt one four of a kind. However, as with all other hands in poker, there is no guarantee that you will ever actually bedealt this hand during the game. 

 Following four of a kind are full houses, which have odds of 4432 to 1. This means that if you were to play with someone 100 times, on average you would bedealt one full house. Again though, there is no guarantee that you will actually bedealt this hand during the game - it's entirely possible (and even likely) thatyou will never receive one.. 

 Rounding out the top three most common hands are flushes and straights. Flushes have oddsof 8192 to 1 while straights have odds 24828 to 1 . This means that ifyou were to play with someone 100 times,. onaverage,.you would each get aboutone flush or straightrespectivelyduring those games - but again,.these are just averages,. and there's no guarentee whatsoeverthat either will happen.. 

 Finally,.the least common hand in Five-Card Poker* is threeofakind,.which has oddsof 16796to1 .Thismeans that ifyouweretoplaywithsomeone100times,.onaverage,.you would eachgetonethreeofakindduringthosegames - but onceagain,.theoddsdon'tguaranteethateitherwillactuallyhappen ..

#  5 Card Poker Hands With Exactly 3 Aces Occur More Than 1 Out Of Every 4 Times

There are 1,326 unique 5-card poker hands. A hand with exactly three aces occurs more than 1 out of every 4 times.

There are 134 different 5-card poker hands that contain exactly three aces. This is just over 10% of the total number of 5-card poker hands. So, if you are playing 5 card poker and are dealt 3 aces, you can be almost certain that at least one other player will also have 3 aces.
This is just one of the interesting facts about 5 card poker hands.

#  How Many Times Can You Expect To Get 3 Aces In a Poker Hand?

In poker, the chances of getting a certain hand depend on the number of players at the table, the type of game being played, and the combination of cards in the deck. However, there are some general probabilities that can be applied to most situations.

For example, if you are playing Texas Hold’em with nine players at the table, the odds of getting three aces in your hand are about 1 in 27. If there are only two players at the table, the odds jump up to 1 in 2.5. And if you are playing draw poker with a deck of 52 cards, then the odds of getting three aces are 1 in 221.

In general, the odds of getting any specific hand increase as more players join the game. This is because there are more possible card combinations that can be drawn when there are more players. For example, if you are playing Texas Hold’em and there are four other players at the table, then there are 52 possible card combinations that can be drawn (2 x 4 = 8 + 3 = 11). But if you were playing by yourself, then there would only be 10 possible card combinations (2 x 5 = 10).

#  You're In Luck - Here Are 5 Ways To Get 3 Aces In Poker!

People often ask how somebody can get three aces in poker. The answer is that it's actually easier than you might think. Here are five ways to make this happen:

1. Play at a Casino

One of the easiest ways to get three aces in poker is to head to your nearest casino and take part in one of their many poker tournaments. There's a good chance that at least one of these tournaments will have a low buy-in, and this could give you the opportunity to win big with a hand full of aces.

If you're not feeling adventurous enough to take part in casino or online poker tournaments, why not play with your friends instead? This can be just as much fun, and it also gives you the opportunity to win some big pots. Just make sure that you agree on some basic rules before starting so that everyone is on the same page.

4. Play in Smaller Leagues

If you're looking for even more excitement, consider playing in smaller leagues rather than bigger ones. Not only will this give you more opportunities to win, but it'll also be more exciting since the stakes will be higher. Just remember to stay disciplined and only play when you have a good hand.
