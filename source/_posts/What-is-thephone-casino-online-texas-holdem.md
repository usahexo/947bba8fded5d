#  How to play online texas holdem?

Texas Holdem is a popular variant of poker, played both online and offline. The objective of the game is to make the best five-card hand from the seven cards available. Initially, each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up (the hole card). The face-up card is used to begin the betting round. The players then take turns in clockwise order to either call (match) the current bet, raise (increase) the bet, or fold their hand (lose any money they've put in so far). After all players have either called or folded, three further community cards are placed face up on the table. These are used along with the player's two hole cards to make the best five-card poker hand. The player with the best hand takes the pot.

The first thing you need to do before playing Texas Holdem is to find a reputable online casino that offers this game. Once you have registered an account and made your deposit, you're ready to start playing. In most casinos, you can choose to play for real money or for fun (also known as 'practice' mode). To begin a hand, click on the relevant button and select how many players will be taking part (between 2 and 10). You will then be dealt your starting hands and the betting round will commence.

There are a number of different betting options available in Texas Holdem:

1. Minimum bet - This is the lowest amount that you can bet on a particular round.

2. Maximum bet - This is the highest amount that you can bet on a particular round.

3. Raise - This increases the current bet by doubling it. For example, if someone bets $10 and you raise it to $20, then the next player would have to put in at least $30 to stay in the hand.

4. Call - This matches the current bet amount.

5. Fold - If you don't want to risk any more money, or don't think your cards are good enough to continue playing, then you can fold your hand which means you lose any money you've put in so far during that particular hand.
