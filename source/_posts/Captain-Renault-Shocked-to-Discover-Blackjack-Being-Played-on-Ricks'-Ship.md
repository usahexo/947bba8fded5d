CAPTAIN RENAULT was shocked to discover blackjack being played on Rick's ship. "This is highly illegal," he exclaimed. "What if someone is injured?"

Rick was unfazed. "It's all good, Cap'n," he said. "We're just playing for fun."

Renault was not convinced. "I'm confiscating all of your blackjack cards," he said.

"But Cap'n, that's not fair!" Rick protested.

Renault was unmoved. "That's the way it is," he said. "Now get back to work."

In a press conference today, Captain Renault expressed his surprise and confusion at being informed of a blackjack game taking place on his vessel. "I've been in the merchant navy for over 25 years, and I've never heard of such a thing," he said.

When asked if he thought it was appropriate for sailors to be playing games on board a vessel, Renault was unequivocal. "There is absolutely no place for games on board a ship," he said. "Sailors should be working hard to make sure that we are on schedule and ready for whatever challenges come our way."

Renault also took the opportunity to remind sailors of the importance of discipline and focus while at sea. "This is a serious business, and we cannot let ourselves be distracted by frivolous activities."

They were not cheating and they appeared to be having a good time. The captain concluded that there was no harm in the game and decided to allow it to continue.

Renault was inspecting his ship to ensure that everything was in order for their next voyage when he came across a table with cards and chips on it. He had never seen this game before, but he decided to give it a try. The game was blackjack, and Renault quickly became obsessed with it.

He would play for hours at a time, often winning big payouts. His crew started to get concerned about how much time he was spending at the table, but Renault couldn't help himself; he was addicted to blackjack.

Finally, one of Renault's officers confronted him about his gambling habit. Renault admitted that he had been playing blackjack and losing money, but he said that he was having fun and didn't plan to stop. He asked the officer if there was anything wrong with that.

The officer replied that there wasn't anything wrong with it as long as Renault could afford to lose the money. But the officer also warned Renault that he needed to be careful not to let his gambling addiction get out of control.

Renault took the officer's advice to heart and started playing blackjack in moderation. He still enjoyed the game, but now he was more careful about how much money he lost. Thanks to his officer's warning, Renault avoided becoming bankrupt due to his blackjack habit.
