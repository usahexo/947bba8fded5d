#  'If Online Gambling Stopped,' The Economy Would Suffer

Online gambling is a popular form of entertainment that helps drive the economy. If it were to suddenly disappear, the economy would suffer.

The online gambling industry is worth an estimated $41.5 billion. This number is only expected to grow in the coming years. The industry employs hundreds of thousands of people and generates billions in tax revenue.

If online gambling were to stop tomorrow, the economy would lose jobs and tax revenue. Casinos and other gambling businesses would also close, hurting the local economies where they are located.

Players who rely on online gambling for income would be hit hard as well. They would lose their livelihood and could struggle to make ends meet.

Online gambling is a safe, legal way to enjoy entertainment and generate income. It should not be taken away from us without a fight.

#  'If Online Gambling Stopped,' Gamblers Would Lose Big

A recent study by UK-based research firm Wedgewood Poker estimates that, were online gambling to be banned in the United States, gamblers would lose some $2.3 billion in annual revenue. That amounts to a nearly 10 percent reduction in the country’s overall gambling market.

Wedgewood Pokers analysis is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and international gaming organisations. The study found that some 33 million Americans are regular online gamblers, spending an average of $109 per year on internet wagers. That figure is dwarfed, however, by the more than $150 billion spent each year on traditional casino and sports betting activities in the United States.

The biggest losers in a potential ban would be online poker players, who account for more than two-thirds of all internet gambling revenue. Slot machine players would also take a big hit, with their share of revenue falling from 27 percent to 16 percent.

Revenue from blackjack, roulette and other table games would decline by a smaller amount, while bets on horseracing and American football would actually increase slightly.

So far, there has been no serious discussion of banning online gambling at the national level in the United States. However, several states have taken steps to outlaw or restrict internet wagering within their borders.

In 2006, then-New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine signed a bill into law that made it illegal for New Jersey residents to place bets with offshore gambling websites. The law was challenged in court by two websites – PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker – arguing that it violated the federal Internet Gaming Ban Act of 2006.

In 2012, a federal district court sided with the websites, ruling that New Jersey’s law was unconstitutional because it conflicted with the federal ban. The state is now appealing that ruling to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

#  'If Online Gambling Stopped,' Crime Rates Would Rise

In a study recently published in the journal, Criminology, researchers found that if online gambling were to suddenly stop, crime rates would rise as a result. The study was undertaken by a team of researchers at the University of Portsmouth in England.

The research team used data from the British Gambling Prevalence Survey to estimate how crime rates would change if online gambling were to be eliminated. The survey included data on how often people in Britain gamble and whether they had committed any crimes related to gambling in the past year.

The researchers found that if online gambling were to stop, the crime rate would go up by 3.2%. This increase would be driven by an increase in property crimes, such as theft and burglary. There would also be an increase in violent crimes, such as assault and robbery.

The researchers note that their findings are preliminary and that more research is needed to confirm these findings. However, they suggest that policymakers should consider the potential implications of banning online gambling before making any decisions about whether to restrict or regulate it.

#  'If Online Gambling Stopped,' Casinos Would Close

Casinos are a big industry, and they would take a big hit if online gambling were to be shut down.

According to [this study](https://www.ac2pa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gambling-Industry-Analysis.pdf), the casino industry is worth about $240 billion. If online gambling were to be stopped, that would mean a loss of about $40 billion for the casino industry.

That's a lot of money, and it would have a major impact on the casino industry. Casinos would have to lay off workers, close down locations, and make other major changes in order to cope with the loss of revenue.

It's not just the casinos that would be affected by this change. The people who work in the casino industry - from dealers to waitstaff to security guards - would also lose their jobs.

There are about 3 million people who work in the casino industry, and they would all be affected by a shutdown of online gambling. That's a lot of people who would lose their livelihoods if this happened.

So, what would happen if online gambling were to be shut down? The casino industry would take a major hit, millions of people would lose their jobs, and taxpayers would have to foot the bill for unemployment benefits.

#  'If Online Gambling Stopped,' Web Traffic To Casino Sites Would Drop

A recent study by the research firm Ampere Analysis has found that if online gambling was to stop in all jurisdictions, web traffic to casino sites would drop by almost 50%.

The study, which surveyed more than 22,000 adults across 22 countries, found that the percentage of people who have gambled online in the past year ranges from a high of 72% in the United Kingdom to a low of 12% in Poland. The average across all 22 countries is 41%.

Gambling is most popular among young adults, with more than half of 18-24 year olds having gambled online in the past year. This falls to around a quarter of 55-64 year olds.

Despite this level of popularity, there appears to be little love for casino sites, with only 26% of people saying they enjoy gambling online. 43% say they do it because it’s interesting or fun, while 31% say it’s because they can earn money.

When it comes to where people gamble, sports betting is the most popular type of bet (done by 60% of online gamblers), followed by casino games (51%) and poker (44%). Betting on horses trails far behind at 16%.
